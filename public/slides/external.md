## External Markdown

Is also supported, and you can use it to include markdown files exposed in the public folder.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Code is also supported, but syntax highlighting doesn't appear to work in this scenario either.
